# operators = special symbol
# unary , binary ......
# unary operators = who need only one operands
# binary operators = who need 2 operands one is left hand side and one is right hand side


         # operators #
 # 1. assignment operators-  right hand side ki value ko evaluate karne ke baad left hand side me daal dete h
 # 2. arthmetic operators- plus minase besicaly matmetical function
 # 3. comprision operators-  jo ek dusre se comparision karte hai
 # 4. logicial operators-  and  , or , and not operators aate h
 # 5. Bitwise oprtators -
